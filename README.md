# Anti DDoS Script v2.0
This is my little script to help you with your machine. It includes Anti-DDoS auto install tool, and System Update/Upgrade integrated.


To start script do the following:
1. git clone https://github.com/dalazkralj/MultiScriptByDaLaZ.git
   
3. sudo ./MultiScriptByDaLaZ
   
If it doesn't start do: chmod 755 MultiScriptByDaLaZ and then sudo ./MultiScriptByDaLaZ
